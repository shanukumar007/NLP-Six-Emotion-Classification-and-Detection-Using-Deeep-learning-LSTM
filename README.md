Overview
This is a simple Streamlit web application for detecting six human emotions (Joy, Fear, Anger, Love, Sadness, Surprise). 

The app uses machine learing and deep learning models trained on preprocessed text data.



## Usage
# Model and Files
The app uses the following saved files:

logistic_regresion.pkl: Pickle file containing the logistic regression model.
tfidf_vectorizer.pkl: Pickle file containing the TF-IDF vectorizer.
label_encoder.pkl: Pickle file containing the label encoder.
## Functionality
Enter text in the input box.
Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted emotion and probability.
Feel free to modify the app, improve the model, or add more features based on your needs.
